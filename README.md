### About this project
\
Portfolio website is a must have for a self-taught programmer like me, so this is my version with the help from Bedimcode. 
\
\
Implemented in HTML | CSS | JS with the support of Bedimcode. This website taught me a lot about fundamentals of web development, and it demonstrates all other personal projects that I have completed.
\
\
I improved the HTML and CSS part of the project, I implemented a new navigation bar and contact section. I also make it repsonsive and fit for small and medium screen devices.
