### About this project
\
A portfolio website is a must have for a self-taught programmer like me, so this is my portfolio website. Implemented in HTML | CSS | JS with the support of Bedimcode. This website taught me a lot about the fundamentals of web development, and it demonstrates all other personal projects that I have completed.
\
\
I improved the HTML and CSS part of the project, and I implemented a new navigation bar and contact section. I also make it responsive and fit for small and medium screen devices. I will further improve this portfolio website as I gain more knowledge in web development.
